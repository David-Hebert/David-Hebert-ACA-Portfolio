            Born in Leander, I grew up in the late 90's, early 00's surrounded by this new wave of technology and internet. I had a strong interest in tech from an early
            age, trying to take the family computer apart and figure out how it worked by age ten.<br><br>
      
            Unfortunately, much of that interest went on the back burner as I got into middle school, and had been practically taken off the stove by the time I hit highschool.
            The workload of school, as well as multiple sports basically sapped me of most of my free time.<br><br>

            It wasn't until I'd graduated from highschool and been forced into a job as a mechanic, something I enjoyed doing on my own time, but entirely hated having to do it
            every day, on other people's cars, did I start to seek an out. With a bit of playing around and a lot of googling, I'd built a few simple, static sites. <br><br>

            With the hopes of getting out of the automotive industry, I've started a journey in trying to change my career to web development.
